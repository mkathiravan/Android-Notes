1. **Memory Caching**: This involves storing data in memory, typically using data structures like HashMaps or LRU (Least Recently Used) caches. Memory caching is fast and suitable for small to medium-sized data sets. However, the data stored in the memory cache is volatile and can be cleared by the system when memory is low.

2. **Network Caching**: This involves caching network responses to avoid making duplicate requests to a remote server. By storing the response data in a cache, subsequent requests for the same data can be served from the cache instead of making a network call. This can significantly reduce network traffic and improve app performance, especially in scenarios where the network connection is slow or unreliable.

3. **Disk Caching**: This involves storing data on the device’s internal or external storage. Disk caching is useful for storing larger data sets or data that needs to persist across app sessions. It provides a more persistent storage option compared to memory caching but is slower to read and write data.


### When to “Cache”?

- Caching can be beneficial in various scenarios in Android applications. Here are some common situations where caching can be employed:

**1. Network Requests**: Caching responses from network requests can significantly improve app performance by reducing the need for repeated network calls. Cache the response data when it is relatively static and doesn’t change frequently. This approach helps avoid unnecessary network traffic and provides a smoother user experience, especially in scenarios where the same data is requested multiple times within a short period.

**2. Expensive Computations**: If your app performs complex computations or data processing that consumes significant resources and time, caching the computed results can save computational effort in subsequent operations. By caching the computed values, you can avoid redundant computations and improve overall app responsiveness.

**3. Database Queries**: In database-driven applications, caching can optimize frequently accessed data or query results. Instead of querying the database every time, cache the results in memory for quick retrieval. This approach is particularly useful for read-heavy applications or scenarios where the database content remains relatively static.

**4. View Rendering**: Caching views or rendering results can enhance UI performance, especially in cases where rendering complex views takes time or when displaying repetitive content. Caching views or rendering results reduces the need to recreate them from scratch, resulting in smoother UI interactions and improved app responsiveness.

**5. Resource Loading**: Caching frequently used resources, such as images, sounds, or other assets, can speed up the loading process. By storing them in memory or disk caches, subsequent requests for the same resources can be fulfilled locally, avoiding the need for repeated resource fetching from slower sources.

**6. Expensive Data Transformations**: If your app involves transforming or manipulating data in a computationally expensive manner, consider caching the transformed data. By caching the transformed results, you avoid the need to recompute or transform the same data repeatedly, leading to improved performance and reduced resource usage.
