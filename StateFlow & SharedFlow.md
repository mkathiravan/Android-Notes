## Flow in Kotlin

---> In Kotlin, Flow is a part of the Kotlin Cororutines library and is designed to handle asynchronous data streams. It is similar to LiveData but more powerful and flexible. Flow is built on coroutines and can be used to represent a stream of values that are computed asynchornously.

#### Key Freatures of Flow:

1. **Cold Streams**: A flow doesn't start emitting values until it is collected. Each time you call collect on a Flow, a new sequence of values is emitted.

2. **Backpressure Handling**: Flow supports suspending functions and operators to ensure smooth handling of backpressure, where the producer and consumer of data might operate at different speeds.

3. **Cancellation**: A Flow respects coroutine cancellation, which means that is can be safely cancelled without causing resource leaks.



### StateFlow:

---> Stateflow takes an initial value through constructor and emits it immediately when someone starts collecting. Stateflow is identical to LiveData. LiveData automatically unregisters the consumer when the view goes to the STOPPED state. When collecting a StateFlow this is not handled automatically , you can use repeatOnLifeCyCle scope if you want to unregister the consumer on STOPPED state. If you want current state use stateflow(.value).

---> If we want to convert MutableStateFlow into StatFlow use **variable.asStateFlow()**

### SharedFlow:

---> StateFlow only emits last known value , whereas sharedflow can configure how many previous values to be emitted. If you want emitting and collecting repeated values , use sharedflow.

---> It does not have an initial value, and you can configure its replay cache to store a certain number of previously emitted values for new collectors.

Note on terminology: just as we use the term observer for LiveData and collector for cold flows, we use the term subscriber for SharedFlow.

##### Example 1: Shared Flow

        val sharedFlow = MutableSharedFlow<Int>()
        launch
        {
          sharedFlow.collect{value ->
            println("Collector 1 received: $value)
        }
        launch
        {
          sharedFlow.collect{value ->
            println("Collector 2 received: $value)
        }
        launch{
          repeat(5){i ->
            sharedFlow.emit(it)
          }
        }

If you run the above program and the output like as below

           Collector1_Received 0
           Collector2_Received 0
           Collector2_Received 1
           Collector1_Received 1
           Collector2_Received 2
           Collector2_Received 3
           Collector1_Received 2
           Collector2_Received 4
           Collector1_Received 3
           Collector1_Received 4  

##### Example 2: State Flow

        val mutableStateFlow = MutableStateFlow(0)
        val stateFlow: StateFlow<Int> = mutableStateFlow

        GlobalScope.launch {
            stateFlow.collect{value ->
                Log.d("MainActivity","Collector1_Received $value")
            }
        }

        GlobalScope.launch {
            stateFlow.collect{value->
                Log.d("MainActivity","Collector2_Received $value")
            }
        }

        GlobalScope.launch {
            repeat(5){i->
                mutableStateFlow.value = i
            }
        }

If you run the above program and the output would like as below

      Collector1_Received 0
      Collector2_Received 0
      Collector2_Received 4
      Collector1_Received 4


##### What are the differences between StateFlow and LiveData?

---> For LiveData you are not forced to give an initial value, it may end up writing more code in init{}; But for StateFlow you are Forced to give an initial value (including null), it may save your code a bit.

---> For LiveData even if you give an initial value, you still need to do Null Check when you access its value (see this), it's kind of annoying. But that's not gonna happen on StateFlow - it will be what it should be.

---> For LiveData you cannot easily, or elegantly observe data changes JUST inside ViewModel, you are gona use observeForever() which is also mentioned in here.
