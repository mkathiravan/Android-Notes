##### Example 1: Shared Flow

        val sharedFlow = MutableSharedFlow<Int>()
        launch
        {
          sharedFlow.collect{value ->
            println("Collector 1 received: $value)
        }
        launch
        {
          sharedFlow.collect{value ->
            println("Collector 2 received: $value)
        }
        launch{
          repeat(5){i ->
            sharedFlow.emit(it)
          }
        }

If you run the above program and the output like as below

           Collector1_Received 0
           Collector2_Received 0
           Collector2_Received 1
           Collector1_Received 1
           Collector2_Received 2
           Collector2_Received 3
           Collector1_Received 2
           Collector2_Received 4
           Collector1_Received 3
           Collector1_Received 4  

##### Example 2: State Flow

        val mutableStateFlow = MutableStateFlow(0)
        val stateFlow: StateFlow<Int> = mutableStateFlow

        GlobalScope.launch {
            stateFlow.collect{value ->
                Log.d("MainActivity","Collector1_Received $value")
            }
        }

        GlobalScope.launch {
            stateFlow.collect{value->
                Log.d("MainActivity","Collector2_Received $value")
            }
        }

        GlobalScope.launch {
            repeat(5){i->
                mutableStateFlow.value = i
            }
        }

If you run the above program and the output would like as below

      Collector1_Received 0
      Collector2_Received 0
      Collector2_Received 4
      Collector1_Received 4
